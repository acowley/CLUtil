-- | One often wants to present a pseudo-functional interface such
-- that \"new\" output values are returned rather than modifying
-- inputs in place. Rather than create a new output value from whole
-- cloth, it is much more efficient to re-use a previously allocated
-- output value. This means that anybody holding onto a reference to a
-- previously computed value will have their data changed from under
-- their feet, so care must be taken to avoid such an eventuality. The
-- result of @scratchImage@ is a function that returns a potentially
-- new 'CLImage' of identical dimensions to the input image. Calling
-- this function again with an input image of the same size will
-- return the /same/ no-longer-new 'CLImage'. If the 'CLImage'
-- provided as input to the returned function is of a different size
-- to the previous invocation, then the old output 'CLImage' is
-- released, and a new one is allocated.
