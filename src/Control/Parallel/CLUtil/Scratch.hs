-- | One often wants to present a pseudo-functional interface such
-- that inputs are not modified. Rather than create a new output value
-- from whole cloth, it is much more efficient to re-use a previously
-- allocated output value. This means that anybody holding onto a
-- reference to a previously computed value will have their data
-- changed from under their feet, so care must be taken to avoid such
-- an eventuality. The result of @scratchImage@ is a function that
-- returns a potentially new 'CLImage' of identical dimensions to the
-- input image. Calling this function again with an input image of the
-- same size will return the /same/ no-longer-new 'CLImage'. If the
-- 'CLImage' provided as input to the returned function is of a
-- different size to the previous invocation, then the old output
-- 'CLImage' is released, and a new one is allocated.
